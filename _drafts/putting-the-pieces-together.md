## _Creator_ started with one simple question. "What if magazine issues could be NFTs?" 

But that one question led to another, and another. Eventually, the blog was needed as a way to both apply, and keep track of the research.

Now that the site is a functional Web 3.0 blog, content themes are emerging, and coming together like pieces of a puzzle. Here's what to expect from the navigation menu.

* Magazine: Eventually the best blog content will be further developed, and packaged into something resembling digital magazine issues.
* Web 3.0: The decentralized web enabling creators to own their platform.
* Blockchain: The smart contract ecosystem enabling patrons to own digital craft work.
* Creative: Everything else related to being a creator of digital media.
* Microblog: Short, frequent status updates. Think of these posts like pages ripped from a notebook, or like tweets without Twitter.

All of this is a work in progress. Not all the holes are filled yet, but you can start to see where the pieces will go.
