I've noticed a lot of people asking for a free domain in the Namebase Discord server. I thought it would be nice to have a top level domain that could be used to hand out free subdomains, so I started the bidding on the domain 3ForAll/. It's a combination of "free for all" and "Web3." It'll take about two weeks to find out if I won the auction. If I win, I'll set up some kind of form on the site to pass out the free subdomains.
