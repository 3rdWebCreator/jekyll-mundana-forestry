Funding is one of the big challenges for creators and media organizations of every kind. Things can get ugly when chasing the money becomes the number one priority.

I recently wrote that good magazines have bad web sites, recalling the frustration of trying to read while pop ups and ads are loading on the screen. _Wired_ is the last magazine I remember subscribing to, so I decided to pay a visit to Wired.com with my screen recording. Unfortunately, the experience illustrated my point perfectly.

_Wired_ may not have much choice, but blockchain smart contracts could provide new opportunity for some creators.
