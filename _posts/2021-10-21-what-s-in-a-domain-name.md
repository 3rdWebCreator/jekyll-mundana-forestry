title: What's In a (Domain) Name?

It looks a little strange, but my author name on the site is now displayed as a [Handshake](https://handshake.org/) top level domain. Top level meaning like the "com" in a traditional .com domain.

I've seen Handshake "Namers" doing this in various places on the web to raise awareness for the domain system. You can find a whole bunch of them in the [Namer Community](https://community.namebase.io/).

Despite the odd look, using a domain for my name does come with some extra utility. Visiting the URL (with a compatible browser or gateway) will direct you to decentralized page of links for my sites and social profiles. The page can be created on Namebase, and is called a [dLink](https://www.namebase.io/dlinks). Check mine out [here](http://timrohe.hns.to/).
