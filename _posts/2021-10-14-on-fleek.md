I finally made the jump to Web3! Let’s just say it was a bit of a winding path to get here.

The _Creator_ blog is now hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), thanks to [Fleek.co](https://fleek.co/). Fleek imported the static site from a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository. The repository was created using a template site through the [Forestry.io](https://www.forestry.io/) content management system. It’s online now at the [Handshake](https://handshake.org/) domain _creator.3rdWeb/_, which I acquired on [Namebase](https://www.namebase.io/).

Clearly, it takes a village to get a non-developer on to the third web. And after all that, it’s still pretty hard for most people to access the site. 

Since browsers don’t normally resolve Handshake domains, I am redirecting my [3rdWebCreator.com](http://3rdwebcreator.com) domain to the Fleek CDN to provide a more mainstream path. The site can also be accessed via the Handshake gateway at creator.3rdWeb.HNS.to. But if you’re reading this, you probably already knew that.
