The new creator economy is about ownership. Ownership for you, for your collaborators, and for your fans. It’s the ownership that enables content to be made for a community, and not for some other agenda, like a brand deal. This [video](https://youtu.be/Yc2m_NfxZj8 "video ") from Bankless describes the “why.”

My hope for _Creator_ is to describe the “how.”
