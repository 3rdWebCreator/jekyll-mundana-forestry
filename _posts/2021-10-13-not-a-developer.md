Web3 still feels like a gated community. You need to show your computer science degree at the entrance, or you aren’t getting in.

Eventually the developers will build a way in for the rest of us. For now, you need to find a loose picket in the fence, and force your way through.

This [video](https://youtu.be/PYPb2fjNVn0) was my loose picket. It’s what got me through. Without a toolset like Fleek + Jekyll + Forestry I wouldn’t have a chance.
