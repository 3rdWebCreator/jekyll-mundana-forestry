Web3 still feels like a gated community. Show your computer science degree at the entrance, or you arenâ€™t getting in.

Eventually, tools will be built that throw open the gates. For now, you need to find a loose picket in the fence, and force your way through.

This [video](https://youtu.be/PYPb2fjNVn0) was my loose picket. Without a toolset like Fleek + Jekyll + Forestry I would be on the outside looking in.
