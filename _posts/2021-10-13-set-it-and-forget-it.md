As I write this, the _Creator_ blog is not really hosted anywhere. Files are stored on GitHub. The site exists in a Forestry.io preview, but that’s it.  
The plan is to host this content on IPFS using Fleek.co. It has taken me a while to get there because I have been messing around with the CSS. Tweaking little styling details is probably not the best use of my time, but if I’m going to be looking at this site almost daily, I want to like it. Soon though, I will set it, and forget it. My priority is to be publishing  content, not fidgeting with styles.
