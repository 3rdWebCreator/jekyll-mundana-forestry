Funding is one of the big challenges for content creators and media organizations of every kind. The web sites of major magazine publishers put the struggle on full display. While they chase dollars, frustrating ads and other distractions drive readers away.

_Wired_ is the last magazine I remember subscribing to, so I decided to pay a visit to [Wired.com](https://www.wired.com), and record the screen. Unfortunately, the experience illustrated the point perfectly. Take a look for yourself.

_Wired_ may not have much choice, but blockchain smart contracts will provide new opportunities for other creators. Smart contracts enable an audience to buy and own digital goods. Instead of paying for access through a paywall, the buyer gets something of value to keep or even resell.

Under that new business model creators can ditch the distractions, and turn all of their attention to making content worth owning.
