A few people have been asking for free domains in the Namebase Discord server. I thought it would be nice to have a top level domain that could be used to hand out free subdomains, so I started the bidding on the domain 3ForAll/. The domain is a combination of "Web3" and "free for all." It'll take about two weeks to find out if I won the auction. If I win, I'll set up some kind of form on the site to pass out the free subdomains.
