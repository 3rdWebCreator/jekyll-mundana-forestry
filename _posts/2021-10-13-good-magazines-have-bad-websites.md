Have you tried visiting the website of a major magazine lately? It’s a disaster. There are pop-ups and ads loading everywhere.

But turn on “reader mode” in your browser, and suddenly the content shines again. Reading the articles is so much more enjoyable without all the junk.

Distraction-free reading was my goal for _Creator._ There’s very little to pull your eyes from the words on the page.

One little embellishment I did allow was a low highlight on the links. The styling was inspired by a WordPress theme called [Patch](https://pixelgrade.com/themes/blogging/patch/). I found a small description for how to achieve the effect [here](https://www.foxinfotech.in/2019/04/css-style-for-links-thick-underline-and-highlight-text-on-mouse-hover.html).

Next, I plan to get this thing hosted on [Fleek](https://fleek.co/).
